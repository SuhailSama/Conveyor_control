# Conveyor_control

This project is still under development. It aims to develop a control loop to control an industrial conveyor that has a 3 phase motor.
An Encoder with 3 channels and 1024 PPR is used to know the absolute position of the conveyor belt(More precisely the objects on it). 
The ultimate goal is to connect the conveyor to a UR manipulator to provide full autonomous object grab-and-move.
